Many Chainlink Data Feeds provide data that is aggregated from many data sources by a decentralized set of independent node operators. The [Decentralized Data Model](/architecture-overview/architecture-decentralized-model/) describes this in detail. However, there are some exceptions where data for a feed can come only from a single data source or where data values are calculated. Read the [Selecting Quality Data Feeds](/data-feeds/selecting-data-feeds) to learn about the different data feed categories and how to identify them.
